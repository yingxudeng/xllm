// Sliding-window leaf of CompositeBlockManager.

// The low-level physical block pool (free list, allocate / deallocate / free,
// num_* accounting, id-0 padding) is identical to BlockManagerImpl, so this
// derives from it and reuses that machinery unchanged. Growth is the base flat
// append (allocate_for_sequence inherited). The sliding-window specifics are:
//   - release_out_of_window() drops leading blocks that have slid out of the
//     window; the composite calls it AFTER committing a successful round, so a
//     failed allocate_sequence never releases the sequence's existing blocks;
//   - the SWA block list grows by logical position and never shrinks in size;
//     released leading positions become invalid placeholders;
//   - the pool is sized with slack (see build_composite_leaves) so the peak
//     "old blocks not yet released + new tail" fits without borrowing capacity;
//   - no prefix cache.
